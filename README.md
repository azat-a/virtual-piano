## Implementation
Note: this project based on [the layout](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/stage1-tasks/tree/virtual-piano) by RS School, I'm only implemented the Javascript algoritm. In this project I mastered:
- working with the DOM,
- handling events,
- OOP in JS using classes.

The code consists of three classes. `PianoController` sets event listeners and handles:
- mouse events (`mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`) on piano keys,
- keyboard events (`keydown` and `keyup`),
- clicks on Notes/Letters switcher and fullscreen button.

Handlers call the appropriate methods of `PianoPlayer` (which stores a list of audio files, creates `Audio` objects and plays samples), and methods of `ScreenViewer` (which animates piano keystrokes, switches notes/letters tips and switches fullscreen mode).

## Using the code
Make a fork of the repository or clone it directly using `git clone https://github.com/azat-a/virtual-piano.git` â€” that's it, you're great!
